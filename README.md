# Radio S.A

This is a project about a web player proposal by [Igor Oliveira](https://programadorbr.com/) on his Fullstack development course.

I've tried to go beyond and create a web radio which reminds me peaceful and unforgettable moments in my life when I used to spend hours on my youth playing GTA S.A with my brother.

Anyway, you can take a look at this project on the link below and try to remember what you were doing in the 2000s while listening nice songs.
